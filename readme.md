# The Creative Environment demonstration project 

> This project is a simple core project using creenv. The logic in the app focusing on setting up the rendering process, and that is all. Some more elaborated boilerplates can be installed using the CLI, please check [the learning table pt.3: the CLI](https://github.com/bcrespy/creenv/blob/master/learning-table/3-cli) if you want more details on such projects. 

If you want an in depth guide about creenv, [please check @creenv list of ressources](https://github.com/bcrespy/creenv). The [**learning table**](https://github.com/bcrespy/creenv/blob/master/learning-table.md) is the best resource to understand how to use creenv.

To understand how the boilerplate works, [**check the learning table pt.4: Boilerplate in details**](https://github.com/bcrespy/creenv/blob/master/learning-table/4-boilerplate).
